# Mini_projects
A collection of small, self-contained projects showcasing my skills and experimentation in programming, machine learning, and more.


## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to showcase my development skills, creativity, and passion for solving problems with code. Each project is designed to address specific challenges, improve my understanding of different technologies, and build a solid portfolio of work. Whether it's a machine learning model, a simple web application, or an automation script, these mini-projects reflect my dedication to honing my skills and gaining practical experience.

## Projects Included

- **Summarizing drugs description using NLP**: This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and process drug-related text data. The dataset contains information about various drugs and their medical uses.
- **Local simple AI chatbot**: A simple AI chatbot powered by the Llama-2-7B model using the ctransformers library, designed to maintain contextual conversations and provide concise, relevant responses.

Each project is independent and contains its own set of instructions for setup, dependencies, and usage.


Enjoy exploring, and thank you for visiting my mini-projects collection!
