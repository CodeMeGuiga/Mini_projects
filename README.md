# Mini_projects
A collection of small, self-contained projects showcasing my skills and experimentation in programming, machine learning, and more.


## Purpose

The purpose of this folder is to showcase my development skills, creativity, and passion for solving problems with code. Each project is designed to address specific challenges, improve my understanding of different technologies, and build a solid portfolio of work. Whether it's a machine learning model, a simple web application, or an automation script, these mini-projects reflect my dedication to honing my skills and gaining practical experience.

## Projects Included

- **[Project Name 1]**: A brief description of the project (e.g., a sentiment analysis model using Python and Scikit-learn).
- **[Project Name 2]**: A brief description of the project (e.g., a web scraper built with BeautifulSoup to collect data from websites).
- **[Project Name 3]**: A brief description of the project (e.g., a basic image classifier using TensorFlow and Keras).

Each project is independent and contains its own set of instructions for setup, dependencies, and usage.
